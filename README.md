# Siwi-Alimi
The project aims to collect less accessible public data for the public good. Here, public data means road control information, and representatively, there are pre-reported protests occurring in Korea. We expect that this project will help ambulances, firefighters, and police officers who are directly related to citizens' property and lives, and prevent inconvenience to ordinary citizens.
